Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

The Gaming Room is a company that wanted to build an online application where people could play a rendition of the game Win, Lose or Draw.

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

I think I gave a particularly good run down of the development requirements.

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

I think it helped give structure to the code and the goals of the code.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I would expand on the design constraints since I think that most other items are downstream from that.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

The main things I considered was the size and experience of The Gaming Room along with the security implications of an online application. It is important to consider the user's needs because if the user isn't happy whatever you made is not good, no matter how cool you think it may be.

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

I took the approach of minimum requirements with room to grow. I think techniques and startegies will vary depending on the client, but ultimately I think designing for the consumer is something that is hard to mess up.
